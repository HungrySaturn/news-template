I’m Sofia Chen, an investigative reporter focused on social justice and environmental issues. I aim to shed light on the struggles of marginalized communities and the impact of corporate greed on our planet. I’m committed to amplifying the voices of those who are often overlooked, as I believe that storytelling can drive meaningful change.
